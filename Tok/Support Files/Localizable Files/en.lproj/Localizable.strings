We assume that you would use Tok to share personal or special moments with extreme privacy, so we adopt peer-to-peer communication, end-to-end encryption in our application，which ensure your information with absolute privacy.</p><h2>Do not require any Phone number</h2><p>Phone number and Email address is not required to generate a Tok account, making sure that  your personal information is not traceable through a real-name phone or email.</p><h2>Invisible IP</h2><p>Tok hides all IP addresses through onion routing encryption technology thus you will communicate with your friends via multiple routes so that no one except youself has access to your IP address, ensuring the privacy of the communication.</p><h2>Automatic message encryption</h2><p>Your message is automaticly end-to-end encrypted when you send it to your friend via Tok. Many communication apps can only encrypt information, but Tok's end-to-end encryption technology ensures that only you and the recipient can read the information. End-to-end encryption technology locks information with special security keys, and only you and the recipient of the information will have the security keys to unlock and read the information. All information is automatically end-to-end encrypted, any more special setting to ensure the security of the information is unnecessary, and the world is free to communicate.</p><h2>Private ownership of personal information</h2><p>Tok insist that your information only belongs to you, so Tok’s peer-to-peer communication has no central server and thus can not store any of your information, After end-to-end encryption, any third party, including the Tok’s engineers, can't read the content of the information at all. Only you are the owner of your information, and the only authentication of ownership is your secret key. Please be sure to keep your key yourself and do not give it to anyone else. </p></section></div></div></body>";
